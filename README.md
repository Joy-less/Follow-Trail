# Follow Trail (RPG Maker VX Ace)
This script allows chasing events to follow the player's trail exactly, including diagonal movement and jumping.

Usage:

event.follow_player_movement - Follow the player's trail

event.watch_player_movement - Start recording the player's movement

watch_player_movement is only necessary if follow_player_movement is called after the player starts moving, for example an event that waits a bit before chasing.
